# AI based Online Exam Proctoring System
AI-Based Online Exam Proctoring System is an innovative project designed to maintain the integrity and security of online exams. Utilizing advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, this system monitors and evaluates test-takers in real-time, detecting any suspicious behavior or potential cheating attempts. Through features such as facial recognition, eye tracking, and keystroke analysis, it ensures a fair and transparent examination environment.

Moreover, the system generates a comprehensive log file named "activity.txt" that contains detailed records of all the activities and behaviors exhibited by the examinee during the examination. This log file serves as a valuable resource for educators and administrators, allowing them to review and analyze the test-taker's actions post-exam, aiding in the identification of any irregularities or concerns. With its automated monitoring capabilities and detailed activity logging, educators can confidently administer exams remotely, knowing that the integrity of the assessment process is upheld and supported by thorough documentation.
